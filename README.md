# Classroom Management System

In this project, a component was developed for an online course platform. This is a component where a teacher can perform operations such as creating and deleting classes, adding and deleting students.

## Live preview

You can access the live preview of the project [here](https://intership-project-1-vert.vercel.app).

## Project Note

This project was developed using Next.js. The project progressed this way because it was desired to manage the fake data with Zustand rather than any API.

This is an internship project. It will be integrated into the project later. For this reason, we act here as if we were only on a teacher page registered in the system.

## Features

* Classroom and student tracking system
* Add, change, delete functionality for classes and students
* Use of fake data (with Zustand)
* Stylization using Tailwind CSS

## Project Overview

- **Teachers:**
    - Teachers can see their own classes and the students registered in these classes and can create a new class. At the same time, they can delete the classes they created.
    - They can add students to these classes and delete these students from the classes if they wish.
